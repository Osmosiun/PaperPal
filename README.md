# PaperPal

Welcome to the **PaperPal** project! 🚧 This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am actively developing features to provide advanced assistance for understanding and interacting with research papers.

---

## 🌟 **Objective**
The **PaperPal** aims to simplify the process of understanding and analyzing research papers by leveraging cutting-edge AI and ML technologies. This tool will enable users to:
1. **Summarize PDFs**: Generate concise summaries for the entire document or specific pages.
2. **Advanced Q&A**: Provide insightful answers to user queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Advanced agents like ReAct will enhance explanations and offer suggestions.
3. **PDF Search**: Allow users to find relevant paragraphs by describing their search intent.

## 🚀 **Planned Features**
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - PDF summarization (whole document or per page).
  - Q&A functionality using RAG and LLM-based agents.
  - Context-aware PDF search.
  - Image understanding within research papers.
- **ML Experimentation**:
  - Model experiment tracking using **MLflow**.
  - Prompt engineering and LLM interaction powered by **LangChain** and **Groq**.
  - Vector database integration using **AWS** for RAG.
- **Scalable Deployment**:
  - Automatic deployment using **Terraform**.
  - Containerization with **Docker** and hosting via **Amazon ECR**.
  - Deployment on **ECS** or **EKS**.
- **UI and Monitoring**:
  - Interactive UI with **Streamlit**.
  - Query mitigation and response monitoring for LLM outputs.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Automated pipelines using **GitHub Actions**.

## 🛠️ **Development Status**
This project is currently under construction. I am working on:
1. Designing the architecture for scalable deployment.
2. Integrating MLflow, LangChain, and Groq for LLM model experimentation.
3. Building a robust Q&A system with vector search.
4. Streamlining deployment pipelines for ease of use.

## 🧩 **Future Enhancements**
- AI Writing Assistant: Features like drafting summaries, paraphrasing, and more will be integrated in subsequent phases.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
This project is currently under active development, and some features may not yet be functional. Expect frequent updates and changes.
